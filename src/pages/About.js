                            Many of our products including framed posters and bulkier shipments are too large to be accepted by national postal operators, so we use commercial companies (like FedEx) to deliver these products that cannot deliver to PO Boxes. We suggest you use a physical address instead of a PO Box address to ensure smooth delivery.

                            Keep in mind that if tracking information states an order was delivered but your customer thinks they haven't received it, we won't take responsibility and reship that order.
                            So make sure your shipping address is correct.
